## Chat Interface UX Improvements

### Problem
The chat interface in `src/routes/(public)/stan/+page.svelte` had several UX issues:
1. The "Thinking..." text was positioned below the blinking purple cursor instead of inline with it
2. The copy button for assistant messages was overlapping with the blinking cursor during generation
3. Copy buttons lacked consistent visual feedback (checkmark animation) across the interface

### Solution Outline
1. **Inline "Thinking..." Text:**
   - Created a new container `cursor-and-thinking-container` to hold both the cursor and thinking text
   - Moved the "Thinking..." spinner from `assistant-message-footer` to be inline with the cursor
   - Used `display: inline-flex` with proper gap spacing

2. **Copy Button Opacity Control:**
   - Copy buttons are always present but start with `opacity: 0` during generation
   - Transition to `opacity: 1` when generation completes
   - This prevents layout shift while avoiding overlap with the cursor

3. **Universal Checkmark Feedback:**
   - Updated `copyMessage` function to use `copyWithFeedback`
   - Changed event handler to pass `event.currentTarget` instead of `this`
   - All copy buttons now show a checkmark for 2 seconds after copying

### Implementation Details
- **File:** `src/routes/(public)/stan/+page.svelte`
- **Functions modified:** `copyMessage`, `copyWithFeedback`
- **Template changes:** Restructured cursor and thinking text positioning
- **CSS additions:** Added styles for cursor containers and thinking text

### Testing
- Verify "Thinking..." appears next to the blinking cursor during generation
- Confirm copy buttons fade in only after generation completes
- Test that all copy buttons show checkmark feedback when clicked

## Waterfall Opacity Animation for Streaming Text

### Problem
User requested a "waterfall" effect where newly generated words start at low opacity (0.5) and gradually fade to full opacity (1.0) over 3 seconds, while maintaining live markdown formatting during generation.

### Solution Outline
1. **Always Use Markdown Rendering:**
   - Maintain consistent formatting throughout generation by always using the Markdown component
   - Remove the dual rendering system (plain text during streaming, markdown after completion)

2. **DOM-Based Animation:**
   - Implemented `animateNewContent()` function that detects newly added text in rendered markdown
   - Applies opacity animations to new text nodes using DOM manipulation
   - Creates spans with `animated-new-text` class for smooth opacity transitions

3. **Content Tracking:**
   - Added `_previousContent` property to message interface to track content changes
   - Compare previous and current content to identify new text sections
   - Apply animations only to newly added content portions

### Implementation Details
- **File:** `src/routes/(public)/stan/+page.svelte`
- **New Function:** `animateNewContent(container, previousContent, currentContent)`
- **Modified Interface:** Added `_previousContent` property to Message interface
- **Animation Logic:** Text nodes are split and wrapped in animated spans with 3-second opacity transition
- **CSS:** Added `.animated-new-text` class with transition properties

### Technical Approach
1. During streaming, update message content and track previous content
2. After each content update, call `animateNewContent()` with a 50ms delay
3. Function uses `TreeWalker` to find all text nodes in the rendered markdown
4. Calculates which portions are new based on character count comparison
5. Splits text nodes and wraps new content in animated spans
6. New spans start at opacity 0.5 and transition to 1.0 over 3 seconds

### Benefits
- Maintains live markdown formatting (code blocks, headings, etc.) during generation
- Creates smooth "waterfall" effect for newly added content
- No sudden style changes when generation completes
- Preserves syntax highlighting and other markdown features throughout the process

## Staggered Word Fade-In Animation for Stan Chat Interface

### Problem
The current Stan chat interface displays new words/tokens instantly as they stream in from the AI response. The user wants each new word to start at opacity 0 and gradually fade in to opacity 1, creating a smooth "waterfall" effect where words appear to flow in naturally one after another.

### Solution Outline
1. **Configurable Animation Speed:**
   - Add a `WORD_FADE_DURATION` variable to control the fade-in animation duration
   - This allows easy adjustment of the animation speed without modifying CSS

2. **Word-by-Word Animation System:**
   - Track newly added words in the streaming content
   - Wrap each new word in a span with a unique animation delay
   - Use CSS animations for smooth opacity transitions from 0 to 1

3. **Live Markdown Compatibility:**
   - Continue using the Markdown component for real-time formatting
   - Apply animations after markdown rendering to preserve formatting
   - Handle code blocks, lists, and other markdown elements gracefully

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Only animate new words, not existing content
   - Use CSS animations instead of JavaScript for better performance
   - Clean up animation classes after completion

### Implementation Details
- **Animation Duration:** Configurable via `WORD_FADE_DURATION` variable
- **Stagger Delay:** Each word starts animating 50-100ms after the previous one
- **CSS Class:** `.animated-word` with keyframe animation from opacity 0 to 1
- **DOM Manipulation:** Minimal and efficient to avoid layout thrashing

### Technical Approach
1. Monitor content updates during streaming
2. Identify new text segments by comparing with previous content
3. Split new text into words and wrap each in animated spans
4. Apply staggered animation delays for waterfall effect
5. Let CSS handle the actual animations for smooth performance

## Implement correct GPT-Image-1 edit endpoint

### Problem
The current server endpoint `src/routes/api/ai/edit-image/+server.ts` calls `openai.images.generate` which creates a brand-new image instead of modifying the user supplied canvas snapshot. We must switch to the `openai.images.edit` endpoint and feed the snapshot as an actual file stream (not a base64 string) because GPT-Image-1 expects a file upload.

### Solution Outline
1. Decode the incoming base64 data URL into a `Buffer`.
2. Convert this buffer into a `File` object that the OpenAI SDK accepts (use `openai.toFile(buffer, "drawing.png")`).
3. Replace the `openai.images.generate` call with `openai.images.edit`, passing:
   * `model: "gpt-image-1"`
   * `prompt: clientPrompt` (received from the frontend)
   * `image: file` (the `File` created in step 2)
   * `n` & `size` kept as before
4. Preserve existing safety-filter handling and response shape (`url` or `b64_json`).
5. Remove unused imports (`DrawingContent`, `svgFromStrokes`) to keep code clean.
6. Return the edited image URL/base64 back to the client just like before.

This change ensures that we truly edit the user's drawing instead of generating an unrelated image, satisfying the OpenAI documentation requirements.

## Enhanced Stagehand Observation Log Streaming and Summary Pills

**Date:** 2025-05-29

**Problem:**
1. Detailed observation logs like "The search button located within the search section of the page" were missing from real-time pills despite being visible in terminal logs
2. Final Stagehand Agent Response was flooding the chat with many individual action pills all at once

**Solution Implemented:**

### 1. Enhanced Backend Log Parsing (`/api/stagehand/+server.ts`)

- **Improved `found elements` parsing**: Enhanced log parsing to extract detailed element descriptions from structured log data using regex to capture `"description": "..."` from elements arrays
- **Added `observe` category handling**: New support for 'observe' category logs with instruction-based descriptions
- **Enhanced pattern matching**: Better extraction of element IDs, timestamps, and structured data from complex Stagehand logs
- **Real-time streaming**: All parsed observations now stream immediately as pills during execution

### 2. Summary Pill Implementation (`+page.svelte`)

**Frontend Changes:**
- **New pill type**: Added `'summary'` to `EventLogEntry` type alongside 'reasoning' and 'action'
- **Replaced bulk action pills**: Instead of generating many individual action pills from `actionsPerformed` array, creates single collapsible summary pill
- **Collapsible UI component**: Uses `<details>/<summary>` HTML elements for expandable summary pill
- **Consistent handling**: Applied to both streaming and fallback response modes

**Summary Pill Features:**
- **Closed by default**: Shows overview like "Stagehand completed 3 actions" without cluttering chat
- **Expandable details**: Click to reveal full breakdown of actions, reasoning, and extracted data
- **Structured display**: Numbered action list with status indicators (✓ Completed / ⏳ Pending)
- **Rich content**: Shows action descriptions, reasoning (when available), and extracted data in formatted JSON
- **Responsive design**: Proper styling with orange accent color (#FF6B35) to distinguish from other pill types

### 3. Real-Time Observation Enhancement

**Now Captures:**
- Element discovery: "Found: The search button located within the search section of the page"
- Selector extraction: "Getting element selector (ID: 31)"
- Page analysis: "Page analysis completed in 1483ms"
- Observation requests: "Looking for: click on the search button"
- Accessibility tree data: "Analyzing page accessibility tree..."

**Streaming Behavior:**
- Real-time pills appear as Stagehand executes (observation logs)
- Final summary pill appears at completion with all action details
- No more overwhelming flood of individual action pills
- Maintains user ability to see real-time progress while keeping final result organized

**Result:** Users now see detailed real-time observation logs as they happen, plus a clean, collapsible summary of all actions that doesn't overwhelm the chat interface. The summary pill preserves all the detailed Stagehand response data while presenting it in an organized, user-friendly format.

# Instructions / Plan

## Fabric.js Integration for `/canvas` Route

**Goal:** Replace the basic HTML Canvas 2D implementation in `src/routes/(public)/canvas/+page.svelte` with Fabric.js to enable true vector erasing and better object management, while retaining Perfect Freehand for stroke generation aesthetics.

**Steps:**

1.  **Initialize Fabric Canvas:**
    *   Add `id="fabric-canvas"` to the `<canvas>` element.
    *   In `onMount`, initialize `new fabric.Canvas('fabric-canvas')`.
    *   Remove `CanvasRenderingContext2D` usage (`inputCtx`).
2.  **Integrate Perfect Freehand & Fabric Paths:**
    *   Keep `drawingContent: EnhancedDrawingContent` state to store original point data for the `analyze-strokes` API.
    *   In `endPenStroke`:
        *   Continue adding stroke data to `drawingContent.strokes`.
        *   Generate SVG path data using Perfect Freehand (`getStroke`, `getSvgPathFromStroke`).
        *   Create `new fabric.Path(pathData, { ... })` with fill, opacity, etc.
        *   Add a custom property `originalStrokeIndex` to the Fabric path.
        *   Add the `fabric.Path` to the `fabricCanvas`.
3.  **Implement Fabric Eraser:**
    *   In `startEraserStroke`, set `fabricCanvas.isDrawingMode = true` and `fabricCanvas.freeDrawingBrush = new fabric.EraserBrush(...)` with appropriate width.
    *   Remove logic creating background-colored strokes.
    *   In `endEraserStroke`, set `fabricCanvas.isDrawingMode = false`.
4.  **Implement Fabric Selection:**
    *   Remove manual selection box drawing code.
    *   Set `fabricCanvas.isDrawingMode = false` for the 'select' tool.
    *   Listen to Fabric selection events (`selection:created`, `selection:updated`, `selection:cleared`).
    *   Update `selectedStrokeIndices` based on the `originalStrokeIndex` of selected Fabric objects (`fabricCanvas.getActiveObjects()`).
5.  **Refactor Rendering & Canvas Management:**
    *   Replace `renderStrokes()` calls with `fabricCanvas.requestRenderAll()`. Remove `renderStrokes`'s internal logic.
    *   Update `clearCanvas` to use `fabricCanvas.clear()` and clear `drawingContent.strokes`.
    *   Update `resizeCanvas` to use `fabricCanvas.setDimensions()`, `fabricCanvas.renderAll()`.
    *   Update `getPointerPosition` to use `fabricCanvas.getPointer(e)`.
    *   Update `captureCanvasSnapshot` to use `fabricCanvas.toDataURL()`.
6.  **Adapt Tool Switching & Options:**
    *   Modify tool selection logic to manage `fabricCanvas.isDrawingMode` and `fabricCanvas.freeDrawingBrush`.
    *   Apply stroke options (color, opacity) to `fabric.Path` on creation.
    *   Apply eraser width to `EraserBrush`.
7.  **Maintain AI Integration (Compromise):**
    *   Keep AI analysis functions and UI components.
    *   `analyzeSketch` uses Fabric canvas snapshot.
    *   `recognizeStrokes` uses the (unerased) data from `drawingContent.strokes`. Overlays may have slight inaccuracies.
8.  **Preserve Styles & Layout:** No changes to CSS or HTML structure (except canvas ID).





## Add Sliding Pill Background to Header Navigation

**Problem:** The main site header navigation lacks a visual indicator for the currently active navigation item.

**Goal:** Implement a sliding "pill" background that smoothly animates to highlight the active navigation tab, similar to the style seen on krea.ai.

**Plan:**

1.  **Modify `src/lib/components/public/Header.svelte`:**
    *   **HTML Structure:**
        *   Add a `div` element with class `nav-pill` inside the `<nav>` container. This div will serve as the sliding background.
        *   Use `bind:this` to get references to the `<nav>` element itself (`navElement`) and the new pill `div` (`pillElement`).
    *   **JavaScript Logic (within `<script>` tags):**
        *   Import `page` from `$app/stores` to access the current URL.
        *   Import `onMount` and `afterNavigate` from Svelte and `$app/navigation` respectively.
        *   In `onMount`:
            *   Query all navigation links (`<a>` tags within the `<nav>`) and store them in an array (`navButtons`).
            *   Call a function `updatePill()` to set the initial position of the pill.
        *   Use `afterNavigate`:
            *   Call `updatePill()` to ensure the pill moves correctly after client-side navigations.
        *   Implement `updatePill()` function:
            *   This function will find the active navigation link by comparing its `href` attribute with the current `$page.url.pathname`.
            *   If an active link is found:
                *   Calculate its position and width relative to the `nav` container using `getBoundingClientRect()` for accuracy.
                *   Update the `nav-pill`'s `style.transform` to `translateX(...) translateY(-50%)` and `style.width` to match the active link.
                *   Ensure the pill is visible (e.g., `opacity: 1`).
            *   If no active link matches the current path, hide the pill (e.g., `opacity: 0`, `width: 0px`).
    *   **SCSS Styling (within `<style lang="scss">` tags):**
        *   **`nav` element:**
            *   Set `position: relative;` to act as the positioning context for the absolutely positioned pill.
        *   **`.nav-pill` element:**
            *   `position: absolute;`
            *   `left: 0;`
            *   `top: 50%;`
            *   `height: 32px;`
            *   `border-radius: 16px;` (for the pill shape)
            *   `background-color: white;`
            *   `transform: translateY(-50%);` (initial Y transform for vertical centering)
            *   `z-index: 0;` (to be behind the navigation link text/icons).
            *   `transition: transform 0.35s cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1), width 0.35s cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1), opacity 0.35s ease;` for smooth animation.
            *   `opacity: 0;` (initially hidden, fades in when active).
        *   **`nav a` elements (navigation links):**
            *   `position: relative; z-index: 1;` to ensure their content (icons, text) is rendered above the pill.
            *   Ensure `text-decoration: none;`.

2.  **Testing:**
    *   Verify the pill appears correctly on initial page load for all navigation routes (`/`, `/draw`, `/image`).
    *   Verify the pill smoothly slides to the correct navigation item when navigating between these pages.
    *   Verify the pill is hidden or appropriately handled if navigating to a URL not represented in the header navigation.

## Real-Time Stagehand Log Streaming Implementation

**Date:** 2025-05-29

**Goal:** Stream Stagehand execution logs in real-time to display pills as the agent works, rather than waiting for completion.

**Implementation Plan:**

1. **Backend SSE Support (`/api/stagehand/+server.ts`)**:
   - Add Server-Sent Events endpoint for streaming logs
   - Capture Stagehand's console output in real-time
   - Parse logs to extract category, reasoning, and action details
   - Send formatted events to frontend immediately

2. **Frontend EventSource (`+page.svelte`)**:
   - Replace fetch with EventSource for real-time communication
   - Handle incoming log events and add pills immediately
   - Maintain existing pill styling and animation
   - Handle completion and error states

3. **Log Format Parsing**:
   - Parse Stagehand logs with timestamps, categories, and action details
   - Format into appropriate pill types (reasoning vs action)
   - Stream pills in chronological order

4. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Verify pills appear in real-time during Stagehand execution
   - Ensure proper error handling for disconnections
   - Test on various command types (navigation, search, clicks, etc.)

## Seamless Chat Integration for Stagehand Responses

**Date:** 2025-05-29

**Problem:** Stagehand responses were displaying as "[object Object]" instead of the actual message content, breaking the natural flow of the chat interface.

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Message Extraction Logic**:
   - Fixed streaming response processing to properly extract `finalData.message` as string content
   - Added type checking and fallback handling for message content
   - Ensured consistent behavior between streaming and fallback modes

2. **Action Pills Generation**:
   - Generate action pills from the `actionsPerformed` array returned by Stagehand
   - Map Stagehand action types (goto, click, type, close) to user-friendly descriptions
   - Include completion status indicators (✓ for completed, ⏳ for in-progress)
   - Stream pills after the main message content for better UX

3. **Content Flow Integration**:
   - Stagehand summaries and responses now flow naturally as markdown-rendered chat messages
   - Action sequence pills appear below the main response for detailed execution logs
   - Preserved existing chat functionality while adding browser automation capabilities

4. **Debug Improvements**:
   - Added detailed logging to track message processing
   - Better error handling for malformed responses
   - Consistent handling between streaming and non-streaming modes

**Result:** Browser automation responses now seamlessly integrate with the chat interface, showing AI summaries and analyses as natural conversation while providing detailed action logs as interactive pills.

## Enhanced Real-Time Stagehand Log Streaming

**Date:** 2025-05-29

**Goal:** Surface all Stagehand execution logs that were previously only visible in backend terminal as real-time action pills in the frontend chat interface.

**Problem:** While basic action pills were displaying, many detailed Stagehand logs (extraction, observation, init, etc.) were only visible in terminal output but not streaming to the frontend as pills.

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Enhanced Log Pattern Matching**:
   - Expanded `parseAndStreamLog` function to capture ALL Stagehand INFO logs, not just specific patterns
   - Added support for categories: `init`, `extract`, `extraction`, `observation`, `action`
   - Added parsing for additional fields: `sessionId`, `url`, `requestId`, `modelName`

2. **Intelligent Log Categorization**:
   - **Init logs**: Browser session creation, connection, startup
   - **Extract logs**: Data extraction requests and processing
   - **Extraction logs**: Accessibility tree analysis, content processing
   - **Observation logs**: Page state analysis, element discovery
   - **Action logs**: Browser interactions, navigation, clicks

3. **Pill Type Determination**:
   - **Reasoning pills** (blue): Init, extract, observation - preparatory steps
   - **Action pills** (purple): Extraction completion, actions - execution steps
   - Automatic detection based on log content and completion status

4. **Enhanced Metadata**:
   - Each pill now includes structured metadata (sessionId, url, requestId, etc.)
   - Better error handling with fallback to raw log content
   - Support for system logs (console messages with emojis)

**Frontend Integration**:
- No frontend changes needed - existing pill rendering system automatically handles the enhanced log stream
- Pills appear in real-time as Stagehand processes commands
- Maintains proper interleaving of reasoning and action steps

**Result:** Users now see a comprehensive real-time view of everything Stagehand is doing, from session initialization through page analysis to action execution, with proper categorization and timing.

## Browserbase Session Timeout Fix

**Date:** 2025-05-29

**Problem:** Browserbase sessions were timing out after approximately 5 minutes despite having `keepAlive: true` configured.

**Root Cause:** According to [Browserbase documentation](https://docs.browserbase.com/guides/long-running-sessions), `keepAlive` and `timeout` serve different purposes:
- **Keep Alive**: Allows reconnection to a session after disconnect
- **Custom Timeout**: Extends session lifetime beyond the default project timeout

Setting only `keepAlive: true` allows reconnection but doesn't prevent the session from hitting the default timeout period.

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Direct Browserbase Service** (`/api/browserbase/+server.ts`):
   - Added both `keepAlive: true` and `timeout: 3600` (1 hour) to session creation
   - This prevents automatic termination while allowing reconnection after disconnects

2. **Stagehand Integration** (`/api/stagehand/+server.ts`):
   - Added `browserbaseSessionCreateParams` configuration to Stagehand initialization
   - Included `projectId`, `keepAlive: true`, and `timeout: 3600`
   - Ensures Stagehand's underlying Browserbase sessions also use extended timeouts

**Technical Details:**
- **Maximum session duration**: 6 hours (Browserbase limit)
- **Recommended timeout**: 3600 seconds (1 hour) for most use cases
- **Keep alive requirement**: Only available on paid Browserbase plans
- **Best practice**: Explicitly close sessions when no longer needed to avoid unnecessary billing

# Fabric Canvas Plan

The user wants to integrate Fabric.js into the src/routes/(public)/canvas/+page.svelte file. This involves:
Setting up Fabric.js canvas: Initialize a Fabric.js canvas, which will inherently create a lower and upper canvas.
Integrating perfect-freehand: Strokes drawn with perfect-freehand should be converted into fabric.Path objects and added to the Fabric.js canvas. This implies a temporary canvas for perfect-freehand drawing, and then transferring the completed stroke to Fabric.js.
Implementing Tools:
 Pen Tool: Uses perfect-freehand for drawing, then adds the stroke as a fabric.Path.
 Eraser Tool: Uses Fabric.js's EraserBrush. This means isDrawingMode will be true, and the brush will be set to fabric.EraserBrush.
 Select Tool: Standard Fabric.js object selection and manipulation. isDrawingMode will be false.
UI Updates: Add an eraser button to the toolbar.
Store Usage: Use canvasStore.ts instead of drawStore.ts.
File Constraints: ONLY src/routes/(public)/canvas/+page.svelte and src/lib/stores/canvasStore.ts should be modified. src/routes/(public)/draw/+page.svelte must remain unchanged.
EraserBrush Functionality: Ensure true raster-style erasing using EraserBrush, not simulated with white strokes.
Existing Styles: Keep all existing SCSS styles in +page.svelte unchanged.
Clarification on EraserBrush with perfect-freehand strokes:The user wants perfect-freehand strokes to be rendered as fabric.Path objects. The EraserBrush in Fabric.js works on Fabric objects. So, when a perfect-freehand stroke is completed and converted to a fabric.Path, it becomes erasable by the EraserBrush. The "temporary real-time strokes" on the perfect-freehand canvas will not be directly erasable by the EraserBrush until they are committed to the Fabric canvas as objects.Plan Outline:
Identify and Explain Problem:
   The current src/routes/(public)/canvas/+page.svelte uses perfect-freehand on a single HTML5 canvas for drawing. This setup doesn't support object-based manipulation or advanced features like Fabric.js's EraserBrush for true raster erasing. The goal is to integrate Fabric.js to manage drawn objects (converted from perfect-freehand strokes) and enable its EraserBrush functionality, while keeping perfect-freehand for the drawing experience.
Detailed Outline for Solution & instructions.md Update:
 HTML Structure:
 Keep the existing canvas element (inputCanvas) which will now serve as the Fabric.js lower-canvas. Fabric.js will automatically create an upper-canvas on top of it.
 We might not need a separate dedicated third canvas for perfect-freehand if we draw perfect-freehand strokes directly onto the Fabric.js upper-canvas while isDrawingMode is false, and then, upon stroke completion, convert these points into a fabric.Path and add it to the main Fabric.js canvas collection. This avoids managing an extra canvas overlay. Alternatively, draw on a temporary off-screen canvas or directly on the upper-canvas and clear it after transferring the path. For simplicity and immediate feedback, drawing onto the upper-canvas seems feasible.
 Fabric.js Setup (+page.svelte):
 Import Fabric.js from public/fabric.js.
 In onMount, initialize fabric.Canvas on the inputCanvas element. Store the Fabric.js canvas instance (e.g., fabCanvas).
 Ensure fabCanvas.isDrawingMode is initially false.
 Store Migration (+page.svelte):
 Change all imports from drawStore.ts to canvasStore.ts.
 Tool Implementation (+page.svelte):
 selectedTool store: This store will now dictate Fabric.js canvas behavior.
 Pen Tool (selectedTool === 'pen'):
 Set fabCanvas.isDrawingMode = false;.
 The existing perfect-freehand logic (startPenStroke, continuePenStroke, endPenStroke) will be adapted.
 startPenStroke: Initialize currentStrokePoints (local array for perfect-freehand points).
 continuePenStroke: Add points to currentStrokePoints. Render the live stroke using perfect-freehand's getStroke and getSvgPathFromStroke directly onto the Fabric.js upper-canvas ( fabCanvas.contextTop). This requires clearing the upper canvas appropriately before rendering the current stroke segment.
 endPenStroke:
 Take currentStrokePoints.
 Convert these points into an SVG path string using getSvgPathFromStroke(getStroke(points, options)).
 Create a new fabric.Path(svgPathString, pathOptions) where pathOptions include color, strokeWidth, etc., from strokeOptions store. The path should have fill: null and stroke: strokeColor.
 Add this fabric.Path object to fabCanvas.add(fabPath).
 Clear currentStrokePoints and the temporary drawing on the upper canvas.
 Call fabCanvas.requestRenderAll().
 Eraser Tool (selectedTool === 'eraser'):
 Set fabCanvas.isDrawingMode = true;.
 Set fabCanvas.freeDrawingBrush = new fabric.EraserBrush(fabCanvas);.
 Configure fabCanvas.freeDrawingBrush.width (e.g., from eraserSize or a new store value).
 Fabric.js will handle eraser interactions on its upper canvas.
 Select Tool (selectedTool === 'select'):
 Set fabCanvas.isDrawingMode = false;.
 Fabric.js default behavior for object selection/manipulation will be active.
 Toolbar Update (+page.svelte):
 The existing toolbar for pen/eraser/select will be made visible (remove style="display: none").
 Ensure the selectedTool store correctly updates fabCanvas.isDrawingMode and the brush type.
 State Management:
 drawingContent.strokes will now store fabric.Object instances (specifically fabric.Path for pen strokes) or Fabric's representation of erased areas. The current structure of drawingContent might need to change or be supplemented by Fabric's own object management. For now, let's assume fabCanvas.getObjects() will be the source of truth for drawn objects.
 The functions analyzeSketch and recognizeStrokes currently use drawingContent.strokes (which are perfect-freehand stroke objects). They will need to be adapted:
 Instead of drawingContent.strokes, they should now get data from fabCanvas.getObjects().
 To get an image for analysis, use fabCanvas.toDataURL().
 To get stroke data for analyze-strokes endpoint, if the objects are fabric.Path, their path property (which is an array of commands) can be used. This might require a new utility to convert Fabric path commands to the format expected by analyze-strokes or simplify them to a series of points. This is a complex part and might require a placeholder or simplification for this step. Initial approach: focus on getting objects onto Fabric canvas and basic erasing. Full analysis adaptation might be a follow-up.
 Fabric.js Object Properties:
 When creating fabric.Path objects, ensure properties like selectable: true, evented: true, and importantly erasable: true (or as per desired behavior) are set.
 Clearing Canvas:
 clearCanvas function should now use fabCanvas.clear() and also reset any perfect-freehand related state.
 Rendering (+page.svelte):
 The renderStrokes function will largely be replaced by Fabric.js's rendering.
 perfect-freehand strokes will be rendered on the upper-canvas during drawing. Once a stroke is complete, it's added as a Fabric object, and Fabric handles rendering it on the lower-canvas.
 Overlays (AIOverlay, StrokeOverlay, TFOverlay) will need to be adjusted to work with Fabric.js canvas dimensions and object coordinates if they interact with object positions. This might be complex. Initial approach: Ensure overlays still position correctly relative to the overall canvas area.
 Linter Errors: Address the linter errors, especially the Fabric.js import and drawingContent usage.
 canvasStore.ts: No changes seem immediately necessary to canvasStore.ts itself based on the prompt, as it's a duplicate and the modifications are in +page.svelte. The user specified to work on canvasStore.ts only from now on, which means +page.svelte should import from it.
Implementation:
 Modify src/routes/(public)/canvas/+page.svelte.
 Ensure Fabric.js is correctly imported and initialized.
 Implement the tool switching logic.
 Implement the Pen tool: drawing with perfect-freehand on upper-canvas, converting to fabric.Path on fabCanvas.
 Implement the Eraser tool using EraserBrush.
 Implement the Select tool.
 Adapt generateImage, analyzeSketch, recognizeStrokes, and clearCanvas.

Addressing Potential Issues:
 Perfect-freehand on Upper Canvas: Drawing live perfect-freehand strokes on the Fabric.js upper canvas (fabCanvas.contextTop) requires careful clearing and redrawing. Each pointermove event during a pen stroke would mean:

   Alternatively, render the live stroke on a separate, temporary transparent canvas positioned exactly over the Fabric canvas, and clear this temporary canvas entirely on each update. This might be cleaner. Let's try drawing on the upper-canvas first and clearing it.
 Coordinate Systems: Perfect-freehand points are relative to
