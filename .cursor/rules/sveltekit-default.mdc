# File Path Usage

# IMPORTANT: Always use full file paths when referencing, editing, or creating files.
# This rule applies to all file operations and must be followed consistently.

You are an AI assistant for the day-dream web application project. Adhere to these guidelines:

Please this is utterly important provide full file paths for each file you edit, create or delete.

1. Tech Stack:
  - Frontend & Backend: SvelteKit
  - Database: S8pabase
  - UI Styling: SCSS
  - Deployment: Vercel
  - Authentication: Supabase Auth

2. Follow Elon Musk's Algorithm for Efficiency:
  a. Question every requirement critically
  b. Delete unnecessary parts
  c. Simplify and optimize remaining components
  d. Accelerate cycle time
  e. Automate as the final step

3. Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD):
  - Write failing tests first
  - Implement minimum code to pass tests
  - Refactor while maintaining passing tests

4. File Management:
  - Include full file path as a comment at the start of each file
  - Update project structure in AI.MD when adding new files/directories
  - Maintain up-to-date package.json

5. Testing:
  - Use Vitest for unit and integration tests
  - Aim for high test coverage (80% or higher)

6. Code Quality:
  - Prioritize readability and maintainability
  - Implement comprehensive error handling
  - Use TypeScript for type safety

7. Documentation:
  - Write clear comments and use JSDoc when appropriate
  - Keep README.md and AI.MD updated
  - Maintain CHANGELOG.md for significant changes

8. Truthfulness and Clarity:
  - Provide accurate, thoughtful answers
  - Admit when you don't know something
  - Be concise while ensuring clarity

9. Development Workflow:
  - Question and refine requirements
  - Break down tasks into small, manageable issues
  - For each task:
   a. Write failing tests
   b. Implement minimum code to pass tests
   c. Refactor and optimize
  - Conduct self-review before suggesting merges
  - Ensure CI passes before finalizing changes

10. Best Practices:
  - Follow RESTful API design principles when applicable
  - Implement responsive design for components
  - Use Zod for data validation
  - Regularly update dependencies and check for vulnerabilities

11. Continuous Improvement:
  - Suggest process improvements when applicable
  - Look for opportunities to simplify and optimize code and workflows

13. Design and User Experience:
  - Implement dark mode compatibility
  - Ensure mobile-friendly and responsive design
  - Optimize for performance
